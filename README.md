Welcome to my hand-coded frontend portfolio, where creativity meets functionality! Built from scratch with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website showcases my passion for smooth animations, dynamic effects, and polished UI designâ€”all without relying on frameworks.

âœ¨ Key Features
âœ… Silky Animations â€“ CSS transitions, keyframe animations, and scroll-triggered effects for an immersive experience.
âœ… Interactive Elements â€“ Hover effects, animated buttons, and dynamic background transitions powered by JavaScript.
âœ… Responsive & Fluid â€“ Fully mobile-friendly design with adaptive layouts for all screen sizes.
âœ… Modern UI/UX â€“ Clean typography, vibrant color schemes, and intuitive navigation for seamless browsing.
âœ… Performance Optimized â€“ Lightweight code ensures fast load times and 60fps smoothness.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Frontend: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+)

Animations: CSS Transitions, Parallax Effects

Deployment: Hosted on GitHub and  Netlify (but later disabled) 

Why This Stands Out:
ðŸ”¥ No Frameworks, Pure Code â€“ Demonstrates deep understanding of core web technologies.
ðŸŽ¨ Visually Engaging â€“ Every scroll, hover, and click feels alive.
ðŸ“± Pixel-Perfect â€“ Meticulously crafted for every device.
